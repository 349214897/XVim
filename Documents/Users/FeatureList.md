# Feature List

Some commands here do not behave as original Vim or just lack its ability.
For example, 'gg' moves a cursor to the begining of document but currently '3gg'
also behaves same as 'gg' where it should moves a cursor to 3rd line.
It is just lack of implemntation. 

If you feel unconfortable with some commands
wait for the implemenation patiently or let me know through the XVim issue page.

The index of the list below corresponds the help document of Vim.
