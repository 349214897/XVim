   When yank and put with block selection it makes inserting some spaces to pad a line.
For example, assume we have following text,
-----------------------
aaaaaaa

bbbbbbb
-----------------------
there is a blank line between two "a" and "b" lines and block selection from first "a" to first "b"
makes ["a", "", "b"] as a selection. When yank this and put at 3rd "a" will results in padding 3 spaces
in 2nd line to put ""(empty string). 
The problem is that when Xcode's preference "Automatically trim trailing whitespaces" will delete the 
spaces after putting the yanked text.
It looks that it does not big problem but when you want to "undo" the put operation you have to type 
"u" twice because the actions taken when we put are "Insert ["a", "", "b"] into each line" and "trim 
trailing whitespace" and first "u" command only undo the "trim..." action.
I tried to group them up into one action to undo with one "u" commnad but could not.
